# Install Django
- [ ] Make a directory for your project and use cd to move into that directory.
- [ ] Run 
'pipenv install django'
- [ ] Run 
'pipenv shell' 
to enter the virtual environment where you now have Django installed.
- [ ] To start your Django project, run 
'django-admin startproject <project_name> .

# Create the base template
The templates in django-registration-redux assume you have a base.html template in your projectâ€™s template directory. This base template should include a title, meta, and content block. The title block should allow customization of the <title> tag. The meta block should appear within the <head> tag to allow for custom <meta tags for security reasons. The content block should be within the <body> tag.
